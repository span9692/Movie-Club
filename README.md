# Screaming Cinemas

Clone the assessment repository from https://https://github.com/span9692/Movie-Club.

Rename the folder to whatever you want.

`cd` into the folder and `npm install` to install node package manager dependencies.

To start the server, run `npm start`. This will allow you to make requests to http://localhost:8080 using any client (browser and Postman).

To stop the server from listening to requests, press CTRL + c for Windows/Linux or CMD + c for MacOS in the terminal that you started the server (wherever you ran npm start).

Your objective is to test the functionality of all features, buttons and links.
